# Nautobot

This directory contains the culmination of my development, experimentation, and production build using the Nautobot application. The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to bring Nautobot to its full potential by deploying it on various platforms and instances such as Kubernetes, Containers, Server, and even set up a High Availability Clustered Application. In attempts to push this tool beyond what the current developers are doing and show other developers how they too can get the most out of this application.
