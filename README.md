# **Pandoras Box**

Pandoras Box is my personal development sandbox. I have compiled and developed many different ways to deploy applications in various environments in this repository. Many of the processes I use in my other projects are first displayed here.

## **Motivation**

My motivation behind this is to take various open-source applications and tools and push them to their limits and create easy-to-read and understand instructions on how to install and use these tools for everyone.

## *Contribution*

If anyone is interested in contributing, please feel free to create an issue, and I would be more than welcome to work with others to share knowledge and help others.

### Usage

If you try using any of these, remember to give execute permissions to the script.

```bash
chmod +x script_name
```

This will allow you to run the scripts as shown:

```bash
./script_name
```

Tip: Add the `scripts` directory to your `$PATH` by including the line below to your shell configs to access them from anywhere.

```bash
export PATH="/path/to/scripts:$PATH"
```
