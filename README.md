# **Keybox:**

Keybox is a repository for configuring applications such as GitLab, Ansible AWX, Netbox and Nautobot to be secured by Keycloak either by OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0.

## **Motivation:**

There are a lot of configurations and repositories out there with a ton of great resources. This repository will hold current ones that I have tested and successfully implemented in both a development and production environment.

### *Contribution:*

## Usage

If you try using any of these, remember to give execute permissions to the script.

```bash
chmod +x script_name
```

This will allow you to run the scripts as shown:

```bash
./script_name
```

Tip: Add the `scripts` directory to your `$PATH` by including the line below to your shell configs to access them from anywhere.

```bash
export PATH="/path/to/scripts:$PATH"
```
