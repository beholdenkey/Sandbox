# **Keybox:**

Keybox is a combination of configurations and applications. Consisting of Keycloak and Keycloak Gatekeeper. 
These configuration guidelines are meant to simplify the process of understanding how to set up keycloak
and Keycloak Gatekeeper as a reverse proxy for redirection and authentication. This process can be confusing
and, at times, convoluted. 

## **Motivation:**

I found various guidelines and articles on this process however one of the unique requirements myself and so many others have is 
securing our Django applications with Keycloak and what the process is to do that correctly.
